Documentation for the SIS Project.

This repository contains the manuals that describe:

- how to install the Firmware on the SIS Hub
- how to plan an SIS installation and how to actually perform the instalation process.
- how to use the SIS to monitor the activities of a person living alone using the web-based SIS Client app

Please note the document "Optimum Sensor Reception". This documents what we currently know about getting the best reception possible.
